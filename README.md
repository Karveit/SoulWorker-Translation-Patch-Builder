### SoulWorker Translation Patch Builder

This is just a simple and robust tool to download translation files and build translation patch for SoulWorker client.

# Side note
It uses game client's file to build the patch, which mean:
- It should be compatible with the game client as long as there are no new updates applied to the game client.
- Your game client should not have any modifications before building the patch.

# Requirements:
- Windows 7 or higher recommended. I don't claim this launcher will work well (or even work at all) for Windows XP.
- Visual Studio 2017 (or higher) or IDEs which support up to C# 7.0
- .NET Framework 4.0 (Client Profile): Full Profile included Client Profile as well. So you don't need to install if you have already.

## Uh.....Nothing here.

Well, I don't what to put here.
